"""
For each week and each look-ahead horizon (3 weeks, 1 month/4 weeks,
3 months/12 weeks, 180 days/26 weeks), checks whether each issue open at
that week is STILL open at week+horizon -- matched by SonarQube's issue
`key`, which persists across analyses of the same project (the same
identity assumption compute_label.py already relies on for the T0->T90
label).

Only computable where week+horizon falls within your scanned range. With
26 weeks total, the 180d/26-week horizon has NO valid comparison point at
all (it would need a week 27+ that doesn't exist) -- that column will be
entirely blank unless you scan beyond 26 weeks. The other horizons taper
off similarly toward the end of your data: blank means "can't be computed
yet", not "no issues survived".

Per file, per week, per horizon:
  open_issues_t          issues open at week t on this file
  still_open_<h>         of those, how many (by key) are still open at week t+h
  closed_<h>              open_issues_t - still_open_<h>
  survival_rate_<h>       still_open_<h> / open_issues_t
