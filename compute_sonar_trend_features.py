"""
Computes SonarQube-based trend ("ratio") features -- OLS slope and, for the
density metrics, population-stdev volatility -- over four rolling weekly
windows: 3 weeks, 1 month (4 weeks), 3 months (12 weeks), and 180 days
(26 weeks, same as 6 months). The 3m/6m column names and formulas match
sonar_git_metrics_formulas.pdf exactly; 3w/1m are the identical formulas at
shorter windows.

  finding_density_slope_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  finding_density_volatility_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  technical_debt_density_slope_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  technical_debt_density_volatility_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  complexity_slope_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  cognitive_complexity_slope_{3w,1m,3m,6m}
  duplication_slope_{3w,1m,3m,6m}

t is a plain 1..n week index (weeks are evenly spaced by construction), not
a timestamp -- matches the PDF's t = 1, 2, ..., n. KLOC_t = ncloc_t / 1000,
using SonarQube's own ncloc measure.

Debt is converted from SonarQube's minutes to HOURS to match the PDF's
TDD_t definition -- a different unit than technical_debt_density_t0 in
compute_features.py (minutes-based, per the NPF-90 contract's B2 column).

A week only gets a value for a given window once it has that window's full
trailing history (e.g. 26 weeks of history before the 6m/180d columns fill
in); earlier weeks are left blank -- same convention pipeline_g3.py uses
for its own burstiness columns.

Reads data/measures_week_XX.csv + data/issues_week_XX.json for every
week_XX scanned by scan_weekly_snapshots.py. Writes one CSV per week to
sonar_trends/, one row per file (artifact_id).
