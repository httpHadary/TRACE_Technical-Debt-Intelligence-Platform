Computes BACKWARD-looking finding arrivals/closures per file per week --
the contract's B3 columns (section 1.6):

  finding_arrivals_30d / _90d / _180d   findings first observed in the
                                         trailing N-day window before
                                         this week's snapshot
  finding_closures_30d / _90d / _180d   findings that were active at the
                                         start of that window and are no
                                         longer active by this week

This is the mirror image of compute_issue_persistence.py, which looks
FORWARD from week t (t -> t+h) and is a label-only file per the
contract's "Forbidden prediction inputs" list. This script only ever
looks backward from t, so it's safe to use as a B3 feature.

Naming: your snapshots are weekly, so there's no way to get an exact
calendar-day window finer than a week. This script computes at your
existing weekly windows (3w/1m/3m/6m, same convention as
compute_sonar_trend_features.py) AND writes contract-named aliases:
  30d  = 1m (4 weeks, ~28d)
  90d  = 3m (12 weeks, ~84d)
  180d = 6m (26 weeks, ~182d)
The alias columns are literal copies of the nearest weekly window --
documented here so nobody mistakes them for exact-day figures.

Reads data/issues_week_XX.json for every week scanned by
scan_weekly_snapshots.py. Writes one CSV per week to
finding_lifecycle/, one row per file (artifact_id).
