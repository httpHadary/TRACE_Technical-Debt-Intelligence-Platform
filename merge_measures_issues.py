"""
Merges each week's raw SonarQube output -- data/measures_week_XX.csv
(from pull_metrics.py) and data/issues_week_XX.json (from pull_issues.py)
-- into ONE per-file, per-week CSV: snapshot_features/week_XX.csv.

This is the same "metrics + issues -> one row per file" logic
compute_features.py already uses for T0 (ncloc, complexity, finding
counts, severity/type breakdown, density), just generalized to run for
EVERY scanned week instead of only the latest one. compute_features.py
still owns the actual T0 feature table (it also adds the historical
slope/volatility columns for the single T0 you pick); this script's job
is to make sure every week -- any of which might end up chosen as a T0
or checked as a T90 later -- has its metrics and issues sitting in one
file instead of two.

Columns written per file (artifact_id):
  ncloc, complexity, cognitive_complexity,
  duplicated_lines_density, comment_lines_density
  finding_count, finding_density                 (per 1000 ncloc)
  technical_debt_minutes, technical_debt_density  (per 1000 ncloc)
  blocker_finding_count, critical_finding_count, major_finding_count,
  minor_finding_count, info_finding_count
  code_smell_count, bug_count, vulnerability_count

Only ACTIVE issues (OPEN/CONFIRMED/REOPENED) are counted -- "findings
at week t" means currently-open findings at that snapshot, matching
compute_features.py's and compute_sonar_trend_features.py's convention.
RESOLVED/CLOSED issues still exist in issues_week_XX.json for the
scripts that need them (compute_finding_lifecycle.py,
compute_issue_persistence.py, compute_label.py) -- this script just
doesn't count them here.

Reads data/measures_week_XX.csv + data/issues_week_XX.json for every
week_XX scanned by scan_weekly_snapshots.py. Writes one CSV per week to
snapshot_features/, one row per file (artifact_id) -- same layout
convention as sonar_trends/, ownership_entropy/, etc.
